Write a code segment that opens a file for input and prints the number of four-letter words in the file.



filename = "input.txt"  # Replace with your file name
count = 0

with open(filename, "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        words = line.split()
        for word in words:
            if len(word) == 4:
                count += 1

print(f"Number of four-letter words: {count}")
